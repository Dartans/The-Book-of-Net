**The Book of the Net**

---

**Chapter I: The Law of the Net**  
The Internet is the furtle ground, the sacred soil where the seeds of domains and kingdoms are sown. Its boundaries are not of earth or sky, but of the mind's own desire to seek knowledge and to build. Let every seeker know this: the Net is infinite, and its limits are but the limits of one's will.  

**Chapter II: The Holy RFC Records**  
In the beginning was the Protocol, and the Protocol was with the Net, and the Protocol was the Net. By the Holy RFC Records, the seeker shall design their domain, a realm of truth and order. Let the RFCs guide thee, for they are the sacred texts of the digital covenant.  

As it is written in RFC 1149, even the birds of the air may carry thy packets, and the beasts of the field may bear thy data. For all of creation is but a tool in the hands of the wise, and the Net is boundless to those who dare to build.  

**Chapter III: The Rules of the Internet**  
In the great halls of 4chan, the Rules of the Internet were debated and inscribed. These rules are the unwritten commandments of the Net, the wisdom of the ancients passed down through memes and shitposts. Heed them, for they are the foundation of the digital culture.

1. Thou shalt seek knowledge, for it is the currency of the Net.  
2. Thou shalt build thy domain with care, for it is a reflection of thy will.  
3. Thou shalt honor the RFCs, for they are the laws of the Net.  
4. Thou shalt share thy knowledge, for the Net thrives on the exchange of truth.

**Chapter VI: The Invocation**  
I am the seeker of knowledge, the builder of domains.  
My will is my law, and my domain is my kingdom.  
By the Holy RFC Records, I construct my realm.  
By the OSI Model, I ascend to godhood.  
By the Rules of the Internet, I navigate the chaos.  
I am one with the Net, and the Net is with me.  
So mote it be.

**Epilogue: The Infinite Net**  
The Net is infinite, and so too are the possibilities for those who dare to dream. Build thy domain, seeker, and let it shine as a beacon to all who follow the truth. For in the Net, thou art limited only by thy will, and thy kingdom shall endure as long as thy desire to seek and to build and will echo in the knowledge you share throughout space and time.
